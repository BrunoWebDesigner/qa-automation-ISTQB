# Chapter 2: Preparing for Test Automation

---

## 2.1 Understand the Configuration of an Infrastructure to Enable Test Automation

### **2.1.1 Configuration Needs for Test Automation Infrastructure**

**Key Concepts**
- **Testability:**  
  The SUT (System Under Test) should be designed for good testability—meaning it’s easy to observe and control during tests.

**Aspects of Testability**
- **Observability:**  
  SUT should provide interfaces so tests can "see" what is happening (e.g., logs, outputs, status codes).
  - *Career Example:* In Yolo Group, you used API responses, logs (via Elasticsearch/Kibana), and UI elements to observe test results.
- **Controllability:**  
  SUT should offer ways to "control" its state or inputs (e.g., API endpoints, UI actions, environment variables).
  - *Career Example:* For API testing, you used Postman to send requests that manipulated SUT state; for UI, Cypress scripts interacted with page controls.
- **Architecture Transparency:**  
  Clear documentation and well-defined interfaces make it easier to automate tests at all levels.
  - *Career Example:* At the Air Force, you relied on detailed requirements and system docs to automate functional and UAT tests.

**Configuration Solutions**
- **Accessibility Identifiers:**  
  IDs on UI elements to help automation tools locate controls.
  - *Career Example:* In React-based projects, using `data-testid` attributes for Playwright/Cypress selectors.
- **System Environment Variables:**  
  Used to switch between configurations for testing (e.g., test vs. production endpoints).
  - *Career Example:* You set different environment variables in Docker for API endpoints during local and integration tests.
- **Deployment Variables:**  
  Settings that control behavior during deployment, such as feature toggles for testing.
  - *Career Example:* Feature flags enabled/disabled via deployment configs for testing new functionality without affecting all users.

### **2.1.2 Test Automation in Different Environments**

**Environment Types & Examples**
- **Local Development Environment:**  
  Where code is written and initial tests are run (component/API/GUI).
  - *Career Example:* You ran Postman/Cypress tests locally before pushing code.
- **Build Environment:**  
  Used for building software and running automated tests in CI/CD pipelines.
  - *Career Example:* Your Cypress/Playwright tests ran automatically in GitHub Actions after each commit.
- **Integration Environment:**  
  SUT is integrated with other systems; runs full test suites (UI/API, black-box style).
  - *Career Example:* You tested Hub88’s API integrations here, with monitoring via Kibana for background issues.
- **Preproduction Environment:**  
  Closely mimics production; used for performance, UAT, and final checks.
  - *Career Example:* You ran performance and acceptance tests here before releases, with business stakeholders involved.
- **Production/Operational Environment:**  
  Testing real users and data, using techniques like canary releases or A/B testing.
  - *Career Example:* You monitored API stability and ran smoke tests post-deployment, advocating for blue/green deployment to reduce risk.

**Technologies for Environments**
- **Containers & Virtualization:**  
  Environments created using Docker, VMs, etc., for isolated, repeatable tests.
  - *Career Example:* You used Docker to standardize test environments across your team.

## 2.2 Evaluation Process for Selecting the Right Tools and Strategies

### **2.2.1 Analyze a System Under Test (SUT) to Determine the Appropriate Automation Solution**

**Analysis Factors**
- **Test activities/processes to be automated:**  
  (test design, management, execution, etc.)
  - *Career Example:* Automated test execution and defect tracking with Playwright/GitHub Actions and Jira/Xray.
- **Test levels supported:**  
  (component, integration, system, acceptance)
  - *Career Example:* API/component tests with Postman, UI/system tests with Cypress/Playwright.
- **Types of tests:**  
  (functional, regression, performance, etc.)
  - *Career Example:* Regression and functional tests automated, exploratory and UX tests performed manually.
- **Roles & skills:**  
  (does the team code? need low-code tools?)
  - *Career Example:* Your team’s JavaScript skills influenced the choice of Cypress/Playwright.
- **Supported products/families:**  
  (does the same TAS need to test web, mobile, services, etc.)
  - *Career Example:* Postman for APIs, Cypress for web UI; exploring Appium for mobile.
- **SUT compatibility:**  
  (tech stack, protocols, etc.)
  - *Career Example:* Playwright’s support for modern JavaScript frameworks matched your React-based projects.
- **Test data availability/quality:**  
  - *Career Example:* Used DBeaver and SQL to prepare and validate test data for automated scenarios.
- **Methods to emulate unreachable cases:**  
  (mocking, stubs, etc.)
  - *Career Example:* Used Postman to mock API responses for 3rd-party integrations.

**Collaboration**
- Work with stakeholders (testers, business analysts) to find risks and requirements.
  - *Career Example:* Collaborated with product managers and business stakeholders at Yolo Group to define automation scope.

### **2.2.2 Illustrate the Technical Findings of a Tool Evaluation**

**Comparison Table Approach**
- List requirements (rows) vs. candidate tools (columns).
- Fill in how each tool matches requirements (language, config, test types, integration, scalability, etc.)
  - *Career Example:* Compared Cypress and Playwright for UI automation based on:
    - Language (JS/TS)
    - CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions)
    - Cross-browser support
    - Reporting features
    - Community support
  - You then presented this table to your QA team and stakeholders to decide on tool adoption.

**Tool Evaluation Criteria**
- Language/IDE compatibility
- Configurability (environments/values)
- Test data management
- Test type coverage
- Reporting capabilities
- Integration (CI/CD, Jira, Xray, etc.)
- Scalability, maintainability, reliability

**Selection Process**
- Sometimes, no single tool meets all needs—may need a combination or prioritization.
- Document and present findings for stakeholder approval.
  - *Career Example:* After tool comparison, you recommended migrating from Cypress to Playwright for better scalability and browser support, supporting your choice with a comparison table.
