## 6.1 Collection, Analysis and Reporting of Test Automation Data

---

### 6.1.1 Apply Data Collection Methods from the Test Automation Solution and the SUT

**Data Sources for Collection:**
- **SUT logs:** UI, API, application, web server, database server logs.
- **TAF logs:** Audit trails from the automation framework.
- **Build/Deployment logs:** For pipeline-level analysis.
- **Production/Monitoring logs:** For real-time and trend analysis.
    - *Career Example:* Used Kibana to monitor Hub88 APIs in production.
- **Screenshots/Recordings:** Captured by automation tools (e.g., Playwright, Cypress) for root cause analysis.

**Enhancing Automated Testware for Data Collection:**
- Log all test start/end times.
- Record test execution status (pass/fail/error) and critical test step results.
- Automatically take screenshots on failure.
- Export logs/results for third-party tools (spreadsheets, XML, databases).
    - *Career Example:* Playwright/Jira integration for exporting test runs into Xray for management reporting.

**Trends and Analytics:**
- Compare current and past test run results to identify changes in pass/fail rates.
- Use assertions in test scripts for automated result comparison.
- Filter out expected differences (e.g., timestamps) for clearer reporting.
- Color-coding and visualization (e.g., red for failures, green for passes).

### 6.1.2 Analyze Data to Better Understand Test Results

**Analysis Steps:**
1. **Review test environment data:** Identify resource bottlenecks or environment issues (e.g., CPU/RAM, browser coverage).
    - *Career Example:* Analyzed nightly regression failures to spot resource limits during parallel Playwright tests.
2. **Compare with historical data:** Detect recurring failures or new issues.
3. **Trace test execution failures:**
    - Find if the failure is new or a known issue.
    - Identify which test step and conditions led to failure.
    - Use logs, screenshots, and API/network traces.
    - Cross-reference with SUT logs for root cause.
4. **Correlation and traceability:**
    - Use unique IDs (correlation/trace IDs) in logs to trace user journeys across services.
    - *Career Example:* Used correlation IDs in API logs to debug distributed system errors.
5. **Defect logging:** Include all relevant logs and data when raising a defect for efficient troubleshooting.

**Note:** If all tests fail due to an unavailable environment, analyze SUT and infrastructure logs for outages.

### 6.1.3 Explain How a Test Progress Report is Constructed and Published

**Essential Report Content:**
- **Test results:** Passed/failed/inconclusive, reasons for failure, and test history.
- **SUT information:** Version, configuration, environment details.
- **Responsible persons:** Who executed or last updated the report.
- **Defect details:** For failed tests, include all relevant logs and screenshots.
- **Trend information:** Highlight regressions, improvements, or new failures.

**Publishing Test Reports:**
- **Distribution:** Upload to web/cloud, email, messaging, or test management tools (e.g., Jira/Xray).
    - *Career Example:* Automated Playwright reports emailed to team & uploaded to Jira.
- **Dashboards:** Use visualizations (charts, traffic lights, summaries) for management and stakeholders.
- **Stakeholder-specific reporting:**
    - **Management:** Focus on trends, case growth, pass/fail ratios, and reliability.
    - **Operations:** Product usage and business-relevant metrics.
    - **Technical:** Detailed logs, defect clusters, and troubleshooting data.

**Modern Reporting Enhancements:**
- Automated dashboards aggregate data from pipelines, management tools, and code repositories.
- AI/ML log analysis: Groups common defects, pinpoints flaky tests, and suggests root causes.
    - *Career Example:* Used Playwrightâ€™s flaky test detection and ML-powered log grouping for faster debugging.
