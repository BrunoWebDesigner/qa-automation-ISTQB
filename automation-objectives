# Chapter 1: Introduction and Objectives for Test Automation

## 1.1 Purpose of Test Automation

### **Definition**
- Test automation: Using software tools to execute, manage, and report on tests for a "System Under Test" (SUT).

### **Key Activities**
- Setting up and controlling test suites for execution.
- Running tests automatically.
- Comparing actual and expected results.

### **Advantages of Test Automation**
- **More tests per build:**  
  *Example from career:* At Yolo Group, you automated regression tests using Cypress and Playwright, allowing fast test execution for every build, much more than manual testing would allow.
- **Automated complex or impossible tests:**  
  *Example:* Automated real-time API response checks and parallel browser tests that would be challenging or impossible manually.
- **Faster execution:**  
  *Example:* Automated CI/CD pipeline runs (using GitHub Actions) deliver results much faster than manual testing.
- **Reduced human error:**  
  *Example:* Automated test scripts (in Postman/Cypress) consistently execute steps, unlike manual testers who may overlook details.
- **Efficient use of resources:**  
  *Example:* Running large test suites overnight or in parallel, maximizing hardware/cloud resources.
- **Quick feedback:**  
  *Example:* Cypress/Playwright tests integrated in CI/CD provide instant feedback to developers after each commit.
- **Improved reliability and consistency:**  
  *Example:* Automated test execution for each release ensures the same steps are always repeated, catching regressions early.
- **Better system reliability:**  
  *Example:* Automated smoke tests for APIs ensure critical endpoints are working before production releases.

### **Disadvantages of Test Automation**
- **Initial/increased costs:**  
  *Example:* Time and resources spent to set up Cypress and Playwright projects, and possible training of new team members.
- **Initial investment required:**  
  *Example:* Developing robust Postman collections and Cypress frameworks took significant time before benefits were realized.
- **Maintenance overhead:**  
  *Example:* Test scripts needed updating when Hub88 APIs or UI changed, requiring regular maintenance.
- **Need for clear objectives:**  
  *Example:* Early automation attempts failed when the team didn't clearly define what should be automated.
- **Test rigidity:**  
  *Example:* Automated UI tests broke when minor UI changes occurred, showing less flexibility compared to manual testing.
- **Automation can introduce its own bugs:**  
  *Example:* Bugs in test scripts led to false failures, requiring careful review and debugging of the test code itself.

### **Limitations of Test Automation**
- **Not all manual tests can be automated:**  
  *Example:* Usability and exploratory testing for new UI features at Yolo Group still required human testers.
- **Limited to what is programmed:**  
  *Example:* Automated tests only checked flows that were explicitly scripted, missing unanticipated issues.
- **Only checks machine-interpretable results:**  
  *Example:* Automated tests could check API status codes or response data, but not subjective UI aesthetics.
- **Relies on automated oracles:**  
  *Example:* Test scripts could only verify results that could be compared by automation; complex visual or user experience issues needed manual review.

## 1.2 Test Automation in the Software Development Lifecycle

### **1.2.1 How Test Automation is Applied in SDLC Models**

#### **Waterfall Model**
- **Characteristics:** Sequential, phase-based (requirements → design → implementation → verification → maintenance).
- **Test automation timing:** Usually implemented in parallel to or after implementation; test runs occur in the verification phase.
- *Career example:* In the Brazilian Air Force, QA and UAT were performed after the main software development phases, using documentation-heavy, sequential processes.

#### **V-model**
- **Characteristics:** Sequential, with testing linked to each development phase (requirements, design, implementation, etc.).
- **Test automation at every test level:** Frameworks can be set up for component, integration, system, and acceptance testing.
- *Career example:* For SILOMS Aquisição, test plans and cases were aligned to requirements at multiple levels, with back-end and front-end validation automated where possible.

#### **Agile Software Development**
- **Characteristics:** Iterative, collaborative, adaptive. Testing and automation are integral to each sprint.
- **Test automation best practices:**  
  - In-sprint automation (tests automated within the same sprint as feature development).
  - Frequent automated test execution.
  - Collaboration (developers, testers, product managers work together).
- *Career example:* At Yolo Group, you worked closely with engineers and product managers in Agile sprints, automating tests in Playwright & Cypress, and running them in the CI/CD pipeline for fast feedback and continuous improvement.

### **1.2.2 Selecting Suitable Test Automation Tools**

#### **How to Select Tools**
- **Analyze the SUT:**  
  - Type (UI, API, mobile, etc.), tech stack, integration needs.
- **Project requirements:**  
  - What needs to be automated (UI, API, performance, etc.).
  - Team’s expertise with programming and tools.

#### **Tool Selection Criteria**
- **Open-source vs. commercial:**  
  - Consider costs, support, and flexibility.
- **Matching programming languages:**  
  - Choose tools compatible with the SUT’s main language for easier integration and maintenance.
- **Team skills:**  
  - If the team has little coding experience, prefer low-code/no-code tools.
  - If technical, choose tools that match SUT language and team expertise.

#### **Career Context Examples**
- *API Testing:* Used Postman for REST API test automation, leveraging your team's familiarity with JavaScript and JSON.
- *UI Automation:* Selected Cypress for front-end automation because it matched the tech stack (JavaScript/React) and team skills.
- *CI/CD Integration:* Migrated to Playwright for better scalability and integration with GitHub Actions.
- *Mentoring and onboarding:* Trained new QA engineers on these tools, selecting based on both project needs and the team's learning curve.
